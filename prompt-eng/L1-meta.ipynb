    "# Meta Prompting (Level 1 Automation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta prompting is an advanced technique in prompt engineering that emphasizes the structural and syntactical organization of tasks and problems rather than focusing on their specific content. The objective is to create a more abstract, form-driven way of engaging with large language models (LLMs), highlighting patterns and structure over traditional content-focused methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined by [Zhang et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11482), the defining features of meta prompting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structure-Oriented: Prioritizes the organization and pattern of problems and solutions instead of specific content.\n",
    "* Syntax-Guided: Leverages syntax as a template to shape the expected responses or solutions.\n",
    "* Abstract Frameworks: Uses abstract examples as blueprints, demonstrating the structure of tasks without relying on concrete details.\n",
    "* Domain Versatility: Can be applied across multiple fields, offering structured solutions to diverse problem types.\n",
    "* Categorical Approach: Draws on type theory to organize and categorize components logically, enhancing prompt coherence and precision."

    "# Level 1 Automation Features & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Context Retention** – Each prompt may not retain the context from the previous one, meaning some details might be missed.  \n",
    "- **Over-Specification Risk** – Overly rigid constraints might limit creative and diverse responses.  \n",
    "- **Assumption Dependency** – The effectiveness depends on assumed knowledge specific to the use case and requirement analysis.  \n",
    "- **Complexity Management** – An extra layer of prompting may lead to convoluted or impractical responses.  \n",
    "- **Iteration Overhead** – Refining prompts iteratively to get the desired output is more cost inefficient than Level 0 Automation (no prompt refinement).  \n"

      "### Explanation:\n",
      "1. **Including Ace Editor**:\n",
      "   - We include the CSS and JavaScript files for Ace Editor from a CDN.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Setting Up the Editor**:\n",
      "   - The editor is set up in a `div` with the id `\"editor\"`.\n",
      "   - A theme (`twilight`) and mode (`javascript`) are set to give it an appearance and provide syntax highlighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Saving and Loading Code**:\n",
      "   - We define two functions: `saveCode()` and `loadCode()`.\n",
      "   - `saveCode()` retrieves the current code from the editor using `editor.getValue()` and saves it in local storage.\n",
      "   - `loadCode()` retrieves any saved code from local storage and sets it back into the editor with `editor.setValue()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Usage:\n",
      "- When you press the \"保存\" button, the content of the editor will be saved to your browser's local storage.\n",
      "- When you press the \"打开\" button, the previously saved content (if any) will be loaded back into the editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This setup provides a simple but powerful way to incorporate an interactive code editor into your web application. You can extend this by adding more features like different modes for other programming languages or additional UI elements for user interaction.\n",
