    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
      "- **NFR1:** The system must be able to handle 50 concurrent queries without degrading performance by more than 2%.\n",
      "- **NFR2:** Responses should be delivered within two seconds of a question being asked to maintain real-time interaction.\n",
