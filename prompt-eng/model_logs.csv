**Introduction:**
The goal of this project is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot for Discord that provides personalized support to students with various aspects of studying, including exam preparation, time management, note-taking, and learning strategies.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Authentication and Profile Creation**
	* Allow users to create profiles, including name, username, email, and password.
	* Validate user inputs and ensure data security.
2. **Content Management System (CMS)**
	* Provide a CMS for adding, editing, and deleting content (e.g., notes, articles, videos).
	* Implement search functionality within the CMS.
3. **Question Bank Management System (QBMS)**
	* Allow users to create and manage question banks.
	* Include features for tracking questions, answers, and results.
4. **Quiz and Exam Tools**
	* Provide tools for creating and administering quizzes and exams.
	* Offer options for different types of questions and scoring systems.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. Front-end:
	* Develop the user interface using a suitable framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
	* Utilize CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less for styling.
	* Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
2. Back-end:
	* Design and implement RESTful API endpoints using a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby).
	* Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database.
	* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access control.
	* Consider adding caching and content compression to improve performance.

Example of how you might implement a RESTful API using Flask in Python:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data store
data_store = {
    ""user1"": {""name"": ""John Doe"", ""email"": ""john@example.com""},
    ""user2"": {""name"": ""Jane Smith"", ""email"": ""jane@example.com""}
}

def get_user(data_store, user_id):
    return data_store.get(user_id)

def update_user(data_store, user_id, updates):
    if user_id in data_store:
        for key, value in updates.items():
            data_store[user_id][key] = value
    else:
        raise ValueError(""User not found"")

def delete_user(data_store, user_id):

**Overview**

The Discord-based study chatbot system aims to provide users with an interactive learning experience by leveraging natural language understanding (NLU) and domain-specific knowledge to offer personalized study tips, suggestions, and resources. The system will be designed to integrate seamlessly with the Discord platform, enabling users to access its features directly within the popular communication tool.

**Key Functional Requirements**

1. **User Profile Management**: Each user should be able to create a profile with their name, email address, and any relevant information (e.g., education level, interests).
2. **Personalized Study Recommendations**: Based on the user's profile and browsing history, the system should suggest study materials or courses tailored to their needs.
3. **Course Enrollment and Tracking**: Users can enroll in courses or purchase licenses for access to content. The system should track enrollment status, completion progress, and provide feedback mechanisms.
4. **Community Support Forum**: A discussion forum where users can interact with instructors, peers, or other learners, share resources, and get support from the community.
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user behavior, preferences, and performance, provide tailored suggestions for courses, resources, or experts to enhance their learning experience.

In addition, consider incorporating features that promote a sense of accomplishment, motivation, and engagement throughout the platform:

*   **Badges and achievements**: Award users with badges or achievements for completing courses, achieving milestones, or demonstrating mastery over specific skills.
*   **Personalized dashboards**: Provide an overview of each user's progress, including completed courses, upcoming deadlines, and suggested learning paths.
*  "
