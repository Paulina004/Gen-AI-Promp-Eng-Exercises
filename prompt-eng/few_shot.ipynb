      "- Ensure security measures are in place to protect user data.\n",
      "\n",
      "##### 2.2 Query Handling\n",
      "- Capabilities to handle a variety of queries related to academics, assignments, deadlines, and general information.\n",
      "- Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond appropriately to user inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "##### 2.3 Assignment Tracking\n",
