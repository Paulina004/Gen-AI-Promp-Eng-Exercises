    "# Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting refers to a technique in prompt engineering where you provide a model with a task without any prior examples. The model is expected to understand and generate a response or complete the task purely based on the given instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the model is given \"zero\" prior training examples or demonstrations in the prompt and relies on its pre-trained knowledge to infer what is needed.\n",

      "### Detailed Requirement Analysis for an AI-Powered Discord Chatbot in Classroom Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introduction:\n",
      "This requirement analysis focuses on designing an AI-powered Discord chatbot tailored to serve as a learning companion in educational settings, specifically aimed at acting as a study buddy for Q&A sessions, providing detailed explanations, and offering valuable study tips. The chatbot will integrate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and specialized domain knowledge while ensuring measures are in place to prevent any misuse of its functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Functional Requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **User Authentication**\n",
      "   - Only registered students or users with valid educational credentials can access the bot.\n",
      "   - User roles may include teachers, students, and administrative staff, each with varying levels of interaction capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question Answering (Q&A) Capability**\n",
      "   - The chatbot must be capable of processing natural language queries related to specific academic subjects/topics.\n",
      "   - It should provide clear and concise answers or explanations directly in the chat interface.\n",
      "   - For complex questions, the bot can reference reliable sources or suggest further reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Multilingual Support**\n",
      "   - Ability to handle queries in multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish) depending on the user's preferred language settings.\n",
      "   - Translating assistance should be available if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Interactive Learning Sessions**\n",
      "   - Interactive sessions where users can engage in conversations about specific topics.\n",
      "   - The bot may ask follow-up questions to clarify or deepen understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Access Control and Security Measures**\n",
      "   - User authentication system (e.g., usernames and passwords).\n",
      "   - Role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.\n",
      "   - Secure communication channels using encryption protocols (TLS/SSL).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Analytics and Reporting**\n",
      "   - Track user interactions, learning progress, and common areas of difficulty.\n",
      "   - Generate reports on usage patterns and performance metrics for administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Error Handling and Logging**\n",
      "   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected issues.\n",
      "   - Log errors and exceptions to facilitate troubleshooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Design\n",
      "1. **User Interface (UI)**\n",
      "   - Define wireframes and mockups of the user interface.\n",
      "   - Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible, with clear navigation between course materials, quizzes, tests, and assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Database Schema**\n",
      "   - Identify entities such as Users, Courses, Quizzes, Assignments, Test, Grades, etc.\n",
      "   - Define relationships among these entities using ER diagrams or similar tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **API Endpoints**\n",
      "   - List out RESTful API endpoints for various functionalities (e.g., user registration, login, course enrollment, quiz submission).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Backend Architecture**\n",
      "   - Choose a backend framework like Django or Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js).\n",
      "   - Plan the use of services/APIs to integrate third-party tools if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Development\n",
      "\n",
      "#### User Registration and Authentication\n",
      "1. Implement user registration functionality.\n",
      "2. Use JWT or session-based authentication for securing endpoints.\n",
      "3. Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
